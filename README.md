# Hacktoberfest Hyderabad
#### Support Open Source and earn a limited edition T-shirt

We're hosting an in-person meetup at IIIT-H on 29th October, from 10 am - 5 pm, to gather all free and open source enthusiasts from the city to contribute to open source projects together. 

Hacktoberfest is an annual  month-long event to celebrate and encourage more developers to become involved with open source software. It's open for anyone, especially beginners just getting started with open source! 

In this meetup, we'll take a beginner friendly session on Git and GitHub, tell you about [GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com), and provide you with guidance to participate in 2018. We'll then let you pair up with other attendees, pick your projects and start contributing. We will have mentors present throughout the venue, to guide you with the technology and making the contributions. 

The most active contributos, who make at least 4 PR's merged, will receive T-shirts sponsored by Digital Ocean.
